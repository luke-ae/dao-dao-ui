# @dao-dao/dapp

Web application for creating and managing multiple DAOs. Live in production at
[daodao.zone](https://daodao.zone).

## Development

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Environments

You can choose which environment you want to connect to. The default development
environment is [Juno Testnet](#testnet).

### Testnet

Note: you can get Juno Testnet tokens ($JUNOX) from the #faucet channel in the
main [Juno Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QcWPfK4gJ2). Testnet environment
variables are in `.env.development` and available by default when running the
`yarn dev` command.

```bash
yarn dev # starts nextjs dev server
```


### Advanced: Other environments

By default `yarn dev` connects to the testnet. For developing against localhost
or mainnet, copy the appropriate `.env` file to `.env.local`. Having a
`.env.local` file will override the default `.env.development` file when running
`yarn dev`.

#### Mainnet

NOTE: this will be using the real Juno network and real $JUNO tokens. Use with
caution. We highly recommend using the [Juno Testnet .env config](#testnet) for
local development.

```bash
cp .env.mainnet .env.local
```

#### Localhost

This will be using a local development instance in Docker. See the
[dao-contracts
repo](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts#deploying-in-a-development-environment)
for instructions on running a local development environment.

```bash
cp .env.localhost .env.local
```

## Requirements

Please ensure you have the [Keplr wallet
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap)
installed in your Chrome-based browser (Chrome, Brave, etc).

## Main Libraries

We use a handful of powerful libraries to build this dApp.
